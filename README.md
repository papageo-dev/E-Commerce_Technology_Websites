# Websites-Templates-VS-
 Some websites(templates) in Microsoft Visual Studio.

# Code Information

The websites were created using "Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2015". I used JavaScript, ASP.NET, C# and CSS rules.

# Description/Information

These tasks attempt to explain the use of CSS rules, to change the look(colors, background, fonts, etc) of a website,
importing multimedia, using structures and synchronizing them using code in a C# programming language.

►Project 1, is a simple website template, with some CSS rules and code in C# programming language.
 The "Project 1/CSS.txt" file contains the CSS rules I used.

►Project 2, is another website template, with more CSS rules, structures and code in C# programming language.
